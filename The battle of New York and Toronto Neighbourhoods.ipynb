In this project, I would like to analyze different venues such as coffee shops, hotels, restauarnts, We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, \u201cClustering\u201d to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist\u2019s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis.\u00b6"
